The Real Estate Application is a full-stack MERN project that enables users to browse, search, create, and manage property listings. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handles user authentication via JWT and bcryptjs, while the frontend is powered by React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and supports OAuth login through Firebase.
